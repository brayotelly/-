🧠 How It Works

When a user writes something like:

> “I feel stressed and drained today.”



MindMate automatically:

1. Understands your emotion using an AI Emotion Analyzer


2. Identifies the tone (e.g., anxious, sad, hopeful, excited)


3. Crafts a gentle, human-like response that feels warm and encouraging


4. Logs your entry for reflection and personal growth



It’s not therapy — just a supportive friend powered by smart technology.
